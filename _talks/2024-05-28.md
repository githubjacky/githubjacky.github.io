<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">
The Louvain Method is one of the most widely adopted community detection
algorithms. Its popularity stems from its efficiency and ease of
comprehension. Despite being intuitive, most of the technical details
are missing in the original paper. Therefore, the goal of this presentation
is to derive all relevant formulas, such as the modularity gain for a
node moving out of the old community, moving into the new community, and the
overall modularity gain for a single inter-community move for a node.
Moreover, I conclude this presentation by conveying the intuition for a
positive modularity gain movement.
