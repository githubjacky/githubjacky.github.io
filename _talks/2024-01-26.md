This talk aims to share my experience in constructing prompts to
instruct LLMs. The topics include, but are not limited to: common
prompting strategies, popular LLMs that are not only used for conducting
research but also serve as the backend technology for software, such as
chatbots, code debugging agents, data science analytics, comparsion between
prompting and fine-tuning, and more.
Additionally, I briefly demonstrate how I leverage the prevailing
LangChain Python API to implement the Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought prompting.
