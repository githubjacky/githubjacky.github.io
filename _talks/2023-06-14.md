In this talk, I first introduce several basic concepts related to classical
machine learning algorithms, such as overfitting, regularization, and adaptive
boosting. I also showcase how to implement adaptive boosting in the Julia
programming language to provide a more concrete understanding of how it works.
Then, I move on to introduce a labor economics paper that utilizes machine
learning algorithms to predict the treatment and control groups of the
minimum wage policy based on demographic characteristics. Finally, I
demonstrate how I employ this two-stage framework, which uses various machine
learning algorithms to predict treatment and control groups used in the next
stage of causal inference on Taiwanese data.
