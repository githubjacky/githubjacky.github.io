With this theorem holding, we can ensure the time complexity of the search,
insertion, and deletion operations within a red-black tree is $$O(log(n))$$.
We're going to prove this theorem by induction, starting with a leaf node as
the base case.


Question
======
- if $$T$$ is a perfect binary tree, $$n = 2^{h+1}-1$$
- if $$T$$ is a complete binary tree, $$n \ge 2^h$$

Can we develop a similar theorem for red-black tree?


Theorem
======
For a red-black tree with $$n$$ number of internal nodes, $$h$$ is less
than or equal to $$ 2log_2(n+1) $$, where $$h$$ is its height.

Notice that it's more practical to restrict the target of the counting to
internal nodes, as the external nodes of the red-black tree don't hold actual
keys. 


Idea of the Proof
------
$$
h \le 2log_2(n+1) \iff n \ge 2^{\frac{h}{2}} - 1
$$,
so we're going to prove that given $$h$$, $$n$$ is greater than or equal
to $$ 2^{\frac{h}{2}}-1 $$. The reason is that, in the context of tree
data structures, we usually regulate the height to have certain properties.
This, consequently, provides some
height-relevant axioms, which can facilitate the proof.


Preliminary
------
- a tree data structure $$T$$'s height, $$height(T.root)$$, is the number
    of edges contained in the longest path from the root to a leaf
- the black height of $$T$$, $$bh(T.root)$$, is the number of black nodes,
    excluding the root, on any path from the root to a leaf
- the color of the root and the leaf node of a red-black tree is always black


Proposition
------
$$ bh(root) \ge \frac{h}{2} $$


Proof of the Proposition
------
$$
\begin{align*}
    bh(root) 
        &= h - \text{number of red nodes on the path with length } h\\
        &\ge h
            - \underbrace{\lfloor \frac{h}{2} \rfloor}_{\text{maximum number of red nodes}} \\
        &\ge h - \frac{h}{2} \\
        &= \frac{h}{2}
\end{align*}
$$

Note:

Considering the longest path from the root to a leaf, the number of the
nodes on this path, excluding the root, is $$h$$, and since there are no
consecutive red nodes and the
leaf node is always black, the maximum number of the red nodes is
$$\lfloor \frac{h}{2} \rfloor$$.


Lemma
------
Consider a node $$x$$, and the total number of internal nodes in the
subtree rooted at $$x$$ is $$n$$. Then, $$n \ge 2^{ bh(x) } -1$$.


Proof of the Lemma
---
When the black height is equal to 0, which is a leaf node, $$ n^{leaf} = 1 $$.
The inequality holds for leaf:
$$ n^{leaf} = 1 \ge 2^{bh(leaf)}- 1 = 2^0-1 = 0 $$.

Suppose for any pair of node $$x$$ and itâ€™s child $$y_i, i \in \{1, 2\}$$,
representing the left and right child respectively, the inequality holds for
$$y_i$$:  $$n^{y_i} \ge 2^{bh(y_i)} - 1$$.

Notice that if $$y_i$$ is red, $$bh(y_i) = bh(x)$$, and if $$y_i$$ is black,
$$bh(y_i) = bh(x) - 1$$. Hence, $$bh(y_i) \ge bh(x) - 1$$. 

Finally,
$$
n^x =
    n^{y_1} + n^{y_2} +1
    \ge 2^{bh(y_1)} -1 + 2^{bh(y_2)} - 1 + 1
    \ge 2 * 2^{bh(x)-1} - 1
    = 2^{bh(x)} -1
$$.

Note: "+1" term in $$n^{y_1} + n^{y_2} +1 $$ means considering  $$x$$ itself.

Proved by induction, for all node $$x$$, the total number of nodes in
subtree rooted at $$x$$ is greater than or equal to $$2^{bh(x)} - 1$$.


Proof of the Theorem
---
Combine the propostion with the lemma,
$$
n = n^{root} \ge 2^{bh(root)} - 1
    \ge 2^{\frac{h}{2}} - 1,
\Rightarrow h \le 2log(n+1)
$$
