<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">
I am a 2nd-year master's student in the Economics department at NTU, and I am
devoted to research on Social Networks and Large Language Models (LLMs).
Regarding Social Networks, I am interested in how interpersonal relationships
are constructed, the factors related to them, and how these factors further
affect their dynamics. Additionally, I am working on introducing Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to solve the network endogeneity problem. The topic of my
master's paper is inspecting the dynamics of relationship networks constructed
from annual call detail records (CDRs) involving more than 300 thousand
people, with each month averaging over 1 billion CDRs. Regarding LLMs, I am
fascinated by the advancements in LLMs and how they can facilitate various
NLP tasks. I am currently working on utilizing LLMs to automatically build
textual economic indexes, such as the well-known Economic Policy Uncertainty
Index.

Software Development

- With the experience of leveraging the
<a href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain">LangChain</a> Python API,
I am developing my own minimal package,
<a href="https://github.com/githubjacky/llm-research">llm-research</a>,
to create an easy-to-use and high-level API to interact with LLMs.
