<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">
I am a 2nd-year master's student in the Economics department at NTU, and I am
devoted to research on Social Networks and the economic applications of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Regarding Social Networks, I am currently conducting innovative research for my master's thesis on 
identifying potential "permanent migrants" through sophisticated analysis of call detail records (CDRs). 

This large-scale data project involves:

1.  Processing and analyzing over 1 billion monthly CDRs across a 10-month period,
2. Tracking mobility patterns of 600,000+ individuals to identify long-term relocation trends,
3. Developing novel algorithms to distinguish between temporary mobility and permanent migration.

My research has potentially significant practical applications for urban planning, infrastructure development, 
and policy formation.


Regarding LLMs, I am fascinated by the advancements in LLMs and how they can facilitate various
NLP tasks. I am currently working on utilizing LLMs to automatically build
textual economic indexes, such as the well-known Economic Policy Uncertainty
Index.

- With the experience of leveraging the
<a href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain">LangChain</a> Python API,
I am developing my own minimal package,
<a href="https://github.com/githubjacky/llm-research">llm-research</a>,
to create an easy-to-use and high-level API to interact with LLMs.
